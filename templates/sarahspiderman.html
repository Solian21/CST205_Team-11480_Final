            <p> Spiderman is my favorite Marvel character. He is really my favorite character over all. I think I always did like the character but he became my favorite around maybe highschool. I started collecting and buying things that were Spiderman themed. 
                For my graduation gift from my aunt, one of the things she gave me was a tumbler with spiderman print on it. I still have it and use it as a coffee cup. I have 2 spiderman plushies and even a spiderman head lego set that one of my friends gave me for my birthday.
                I like the fact that the character is someone who is just a teenager and their whole message is that with great power comes great responsibility. The higher up you go the more responsibilities you have to make sure you do. I have watched almost if not all spiderman movies. I also enjoy watching Thor's movies as well. Besides Marvel movies, I watch a lot of horror movies.  </p>
