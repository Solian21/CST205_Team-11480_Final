        <p>I started doing pottery my senior year of high school and I honestly fell in love with it. 
          it allowed me to be so creative in a way that I wasn't really able to be in the past.
          I think what also drew me to pottery was a tactile it is. I love being able to do things with my hands 
          to create things, which is why I was in music for many years but this was a different kind of feeling. 
          The process from start to finish was so fulfilling. You never knew what was going to survive the many
          processes that are involved in pottery. Even if you spent so long a particular piece it was not 
          guaranteed to make it in the kiln. I enjoyed that kind of not knowing. My goal in the future, once
          I have a stable job and a place to call my home I want to have a pottery studio and make all of the 
          dishes that I would ever need. I'm excited for the future and all of things that I will be able to create.
